This week I attended a Girl Develop It code and coffee meetup. I spent much of my time discussing the pros and cons of coding bootcamps with several women who were considering making the leap. One of the women was obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in Digital Media and Web Technology at the University of Maryland University College. While she believed she was gaining great skills in HTML and CSS, she said she was also hoping to eventually learn to program as well. 

She asked if I thought it was more beneficial to learn the programming or the design first. And I had no idea what to tell her. I was impressed with her skills and she was impressed with mine. I went home and thought about it some more. I started to wonder why my bootcamp was so light on HTML and CSS. 

Reflecting on my final project, which required the use of CSS, I realized that was one of the most difficult aspects of the project for me. While programming a full React/Redux should have been the toughest part, it was adding responsive layout, including images, etc. that I spent the most time on. 

After this I started thinking about the students I’ve met throughout my time at Flatiron School. Many of them come to bootcamp with a background in design. (And their projects are much more beautiful than mine!) It finally clicked for me. 

I am still not sure whether it’s better to learn the design side or the programming side first. But I now realize that is common to come from design and move into programming. So, I forgave myself for not being a design expert, enrolled in a Udemy course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](http://codingheroes.io) and dug in.
