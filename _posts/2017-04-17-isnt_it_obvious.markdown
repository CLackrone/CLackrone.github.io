In my twenties, I was the “tech savvy” one among my friends. I wore the title with pride. I was always able to stay two steps ahead and could help a friend set up a wireless network or employ just a bit of html at work. 

When I met my husband, a man who has been living, eating, and breathing computer science for his entire life, I got lazy. He could do everything so much better than I could, so why should I bother? 

We named our first daughter Ada, an homage to [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), the first lady of programming. It was really the first time I’d examined my own relationship with women in STEM and I loved it. I loved doing something that symbolized our intent to raise independent daughters. We named our second daughter Eliza, in part because we liked it, but in part because [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is another nod to computer science. 

So here I am, with two children named after computer science legends, and I know next to nothing anymore about current technology. I feel like a poser. Add to that the fact that I have a couple of unsatisfying careers behind me, and nearly 5 years of being a stay-at-home mom. It’s time for me to decide what to do when I grow up. 

Returning to the workforce in a new field or a previous one will take work. I’ve asked myself some questions this year: 

- How am I supposed to cultivate a curiosity about STEM in my daughters if I’m not “the math and science type” myself? 
- What can I learn that will help me become a relevant candidate in today’s job market? 
- Is there a field that will give me the flexibility to be present for my kids while still giving me professional satisfaction?  
When I put all the pieces together, web development seemed like the obvious choice. 

So far, it’s been a really exciting journey. The material challenges me to think in new ways and really dig for the answers. But I have the determination to keep pushing, and every time I make a breakthrough I experience a kind of fulfillment I have never felt as a professional. 

In an era of unprecedented support for women in STEM fields, the door is wide open for me. At a time when my girls are still young, I have the opportunity to become a great example for them of what they can accomplish.
