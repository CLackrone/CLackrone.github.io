It took me an entire week to complete my CLI project. My Sinatra project has taken me about a day and a half. It is a huge boost to my confidence that I was able to finish this so quickly. 

I did end up doing yet another project with a running related theme. I promise to move into other areas of interest with my next one.

Some lessons I learned with this project:

- KISS: keep it simple, stupid. Oh boy how this rang true for me. After struggling to make a join table work, diagramming, googling, reviewing past labs and lessons, I decided to simplify. I had begun to question why I had structured my app the way I had, and realized it was mainly so that I could stretch myself by creating more complicated relationships. So I scaled back. I recognize that databases aren't going away and I need to get this one down. But for the scope of this project, I decided that didn't need to be my focus. 
- Tux!! For some reason, debugging has not come naturally to me thus far. And then for some reason, Tux just clicked. I used it a lot with this project to double check my work, test my database, and generally ensure that everything was being saved the way I wanted it to.
- Bootstrap- I used a very simple bootstrap layout for this project and it made everything just a little prettier. I may take some more time to fiddle with this. But for my first time, I just went with their basic template and am very grateful it exists.

I really enjoyed this project. It wasn't nearly as terrifying for me as the first one and I'm hoping it just gets better from here!
