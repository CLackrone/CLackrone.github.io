I’m a runner. It’s taken me two years to say that. I started running two years ago, but only on a treadmill, by myself. I never liked calling myself a runner because it didn’t feel true. This spring I joined a local running group and started running with other people. I finally ran my first 5k and loved it. I’ve started to immerse myself in the culture of running because I have found that I love the community. 

I chose to do my CLI project on something related to running as a way of establishing for myself that I was, indeed, a runner. I was waist-deep in my code when I realized that this project was helping me to establish myself as a runner and a programmer. By the time I published my gem this morning, I felt comfortable claiming both titles. 

There have been a lot of parallels for me during this project. Never in my life did I expect to code or run. I certainly never expected to enjoy them, be good at them, or use them as a way to challenge myself. I have now dipped my toe in the water with both communities and, through becoming vulnerable, have grown more comfortable participating in both. 

Now more about the gem! I moved slowly through this because I kept learning from it. Most of my takeaways were general in nature and I’m glad that’s the case. For example: 

- Pry is your friend if you just learn how to use it
- Scraping poorly written html is possible and you'll feel like a superhero when you succeed
- Your community of coders is one of your best resources- before you resort to actually banging your head against a wall, ask a friend
- Sometimes, it's a stray comma holding you up 
- C&P is a great safeguard against typos
- There is no single correct way to do something. Flexibility and creativity are powerful tools

This was the first project I’ve built from scratch. I feel like I should be more proud of myself, but I know enough to recognize that there is still plenty of room for improvement. However, it was really fun to see a project come together. I have a greater understanding of how all the pieces fit together now. I enjoyed the challenge of designing working code on my own.
