When I set out to learn code, I was a complete newbie. I had no experience with coding prior starting bootcamp aside from a few free introductory courses. So completing Flatiron School’s full stack web development program taught me nearly everything I know about programming. By the end of my program, I was proficient in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React/Redux, jQuery, and several smaller frameworks and technologies. I can build an app, design the front and back ends, and, most importantly, I have the skills to learn new languages, libraries and technologies. 

I wanted to continue learning so that I could, a) stay current, and b) make myself a more well rounded programmer. Fortunately for me, [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) exists! I made a list of technologies I wanted to learn and purchased courses to help me learn the basics. 

Currently, I am learning more about the fundamentals of html/css and web design. The course walks you, step by step, through building a responsive website, including the core features of a great modern website. In addition to practicing the mechanics of html and css, I am learning a lot that I did not know about web design. I have never considered myself visually creative, so web design has always been daunting to me. It is so relieving to learn that nobody is building their websites from scratch!

When designing a website, there are a lot of components that need to work together to produce a beautiful, cohesive site that is a good experience for the user. Fortunately, I have also found lots of good resources to help as I practice: 

- Typography
    - https://fonts.google.com (free fonts )
    - https://fontpair.co (font pairings)
- Colors & gradients
    - https://flatuicolors.com (palette picker)
    - https://uigradients.com 
- Images & patterns
    - http://thestocks.im (free images!)
    - http://thepatternlibrary.com 
- Icons
    - https://ionicons.com (good fonts for icons)
- Spacing and layout
    - https://dribbble.com (great inspiration!)
- User experience
    - http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals (crash course)

Continuous education is pivotal to being a good programmer. I keep a running list of frameworks and skills I want to add to continue growing as a developer and I can’t wait to tackle them all!
