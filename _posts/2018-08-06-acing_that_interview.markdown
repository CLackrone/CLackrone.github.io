Let’s talk about job hunting for a few minutes. Job hunting is hard!! When done by the book, conducting a job search can be a full time job in itself. After an exhaustive job search, simply going to work is going to feel relaxing by comparison! 

I am now a few weeks in to my search for that first job in a technical field and I don’t mind sharing. It’s been nerve-wracking! Having come from an entirely non-technical professional background, I was really nervous about technical interviewing. Now that the bandaid has been ripped off, I feel a lot better. But I’ve learned a lot along the way and I’d like to share it with anyone else who wants to get their search off on the right foot. 

I’ll start with a few things I’ve learned about interviewing through this process that have been invaluable for me:

**Plan your answers**

We’ve all heard them. ‘Tell me about a time…’, ‘So, what got you interested in…’, or simply ‘Tell me about yourself.’ These are valuable interview questions, they get asked in every single interview, but until recently I had never bothered to prepare answers for them. Once I did, cultural interviewing became a breeze. 

Figure out what the most common questions are and ask yourself what your interviewer is really hoping to learn. Hint: When they ask you to tell them about yourself, they are not interested in your hobbies. And while we all understand this, if you haven’t prepared your ‘tell me about yourself’ answer, you may find yourself rambling until you bring up that kayaking trip you took last summer. 

**Do your research**

In the weeks that I have been job searching in earnest, nearly every interviewer I have sat down with openly asked me how much of their company’s work I was familiar with. Do your research. Read up on the company, their projects, know their stack, their culture, their leaders. It shows that you are interested in working for them, and not just interested in having a job. 

**Prepare questions**

I now know that in past job searches, this is where I probably failed in many interviews. I never prepared questions. It always seemed to catch me by surprise and I would end up saying, “No, but can I email you if I think of anything?” That is the wrong answer. 

As you are doing that research on the company, you will come up with questions. These go hand in hand. If you do your research and prepare thoughtful questions, it shows the interviewer that you care. 

Oh, and while we’re at it, focus your questions on the company, its direction, its operations, and not yourself. Questions about benefits and mentorship can come later. 

**You can’t fake technical knowledge**

Do not go into a technical interview unprepared. I repeat, do not go into a technical interview unprepared!

All the technical interviews I have had so far have followed the same format. Pair-programming to ‘build a function that…’ (does something that sounds simple, but is actually really complicated). 

To prepare for this, I highly recommend spending several hours on CodeWars. Find out what language you will be coding in and train like your life depends on it. 

In addition to intense algorithm training prior to a technical interview, it’s important to stay current overall. You’ve finished school, you’re busy networking and it’s easier than you think to stop coding. Find a side project to work on, and make sure you’re coding at least a few times a week. 

There is a lot more to a good job search than the interview. I chose to focus on just interview skills today. But, according to one friend who I spoke with recently, with these interview skills, combined with the rest of an exhaustive job search, ‘how could you not receive a great job offer?’
