It takes a village to build a website. Let’s start off by tipping our hats to the pioneers who devoted their lives to the tedious work of designing and maintaining the infrastructure that makes all this work. Without the admins who will give up sleep in order to keep their servers running 24/7, this world we all rely on in some way would not work.

Now, Mom, because you are an English teacher, I will compare web development to writing an essay. 

First you brainstorm. Take an idea and start to consider what elements will make it whole. 

Second, diagram. This is where you start to take your elements and give them a structure. In an essay, you would need to decide what information you should introduce in your opening paragraph, in which order to place your arguments in the body paragraphs, and how to conclude your essay- how to ensure your user walks away from the experience with whatever it is you want them to take away from it. 

Web design follows a similar format. How do you want your user to walk through your website? What do you want them to take away from their visit? 

After diagramming, you need to start writing. This is the fleshing out of those ideas you have, filling in your structure with actual meat. For a writer, this would mean beginning your rough draft. Put your content together in the way you planned it, reconfiguring until you’re happy with the way you’ve conveyed your ideas. For a web developer, this is where HTML comes in. You’re taking your ideas and essentially telling them where to live on your page. HTML works by wrapping all of your elements (text, images, etc) in tags that position those elements and give them some information on how to behave. 

Every essay needs a final draft, right? This is when you start pulling out your thesaurus to punch up your vocabulary, rewrite sentences to avoid passive writing and strengthen your arguments. CSS the language that makes a website “pretty.” CSS stands for cascading style sheets and you build these files to tell each element of your website what you want it to look like. Font, color, size, etc. 

In conclusion (don’t you like how I’m still terrible at introducing my conclusion, Mom?), web design is like writing an essay because you take the structures others have built before you and add your ideas to create something beautiful.
